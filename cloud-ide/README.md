- [ ] Basic UI - Home Page, Folder structure, code editor, terminal.
- [ ] On Home Page, show past projects and create project.
- [ ] On create project, start a docker container for the type of project like python, node, etc.
- [ ] For a past active project, start that particular docker container. Ideally, would need to handle initialising the container with the file system, packages. Currently out of scope.
- [ ] Commands in terminal should be relayed to the terminal in docker container.
- [ ] Real time code updates should be persisted in local file system (ideally to s3 periodically as well) and is mounted to docker container to keep things simple.
